# Scooby_Doo_colorscheme
I made Scooby_doo_Vim Colorscheme

Scooby_Doo is a Scooby Doo colors driven theme, I have never seen those colors combined on any interperter or text editor. It consists of 5 Scooby Doo's charcaters warm colors, perfect for coding with a retro cartoon TV vibes!

#ADD IT TO YOUR ~/.vim/colors
. Supports both vim and neovim 
.  Highly configurable with 4 different flavours and ability to create your own!

Enjoy! ZOINK
